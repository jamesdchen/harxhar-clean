> **NO REAL IV DATA IS WIRED IN.** Every concrete number this module can

Strategy-level evaluation scaffold for harxhar volatility forecasts.

The primary P&L is a **delta-hedged ATM straddle**: a path-dependent eval
that consumes the per-bar realized variance and weights it by dollar-gamma
at the bar's underlying level. The diagnostic, reported alongside, is a
**variance-swap** P&L — path-independent, one-number-per-day, used to flag
divergences that signal path-dependence regimes.

Strategy code depends only on the thin :class:`IVProvider` protocol; the
shipped :class:`SyntheticIVProvider` is for plumbing tests only and is
labelled FAKE at every layer (class name, docstring, ``__init__`` warning,
``__repr__``). The :class:`OptionChainProvider` slot is a documented
``NotImplementedError`` stub awaiting real chain ingestion.

The centralized future-work tracker for harxhar lives at
``writeup/future_work.md``. Items relevant to this module:

- ``STRAT-01`` — surface dynamics / IV evolution. The scaffold freezes IV at
  session open and ignores intraday level changes, term structure, and skew.
  Replacing this requires a surface model (Heston / SVI / similar).
- ``STRAT-02`` — real option-chain ingestion (``OptionChainProvider``).
- ``STRAT-03`` — absolute SPY price level. The scaffold reconstructs the
  underlying from ``sumret`` with an arbitrary ``S0=100`` baseline; raw
  dollar magnitudes are in normalized units, ratio-based metrics are
  scale-invariant.
- ``STRAT-08`` — per-horizon QLIKE-vs-strategy-Sharpe consistency study.
  Once real IV / chain data lands, sanity-check that QLIKE-better
  forecasts tend toward higher Sharpe on this strategy eval. A research
  item, not a unit test; deferred until ``STRAT-01`` / ``STRAT-02``.

See ``writeup/future_work.md`` for the full list (``STRAT-01`` through
``STRAT-08``) and for the canonical "blocker / what changes when fixed"
notes per item. Module docstrings reference items by ID so a grep for
``STRAT-0N`` surfaces every still-stale callsite.

    Returns the annualized ATM IV observed at the **session open** of

    i.e., the *level* of implied vol does not move intraday, and the
    *surface* (skew, term structure, smile) is not modeled at all. Only
    ``tau_remaining`` evolves bar-by-bar, which is mechanical (it is the
    deterministic shape of gamma's time-decay), not a market model.

    This assumption is **wrong in reality**: IV moves intraday and the
    smile / term-structure matter for any non-ATM or multi-day eval. It is
    acceptable here only for an ATM-at-open, single-day-tenor,
    scaffold-grade backtest because the dominant first-order P&L driver is
    ``(RV - IV**2)``, not surface evolution. Replacing this with a real
    surface model is an explicit known-future-work item — see

    to non-ATM strategies, multi-day holds, or skew trades without first
    implementing surface dynamics.

    section "Aggregation Contract -- aggregate_to_daily" / "Filter Algorithm -- Exact
    Specification" for the canonical algorithm. This function follows that pseudocode
    line-for-line; if a true bug is found, fix it in the plan first.

    Key invariants the implementation MUST preserve (verbatim from the plan):

      INVARIANT 1: path_df rows exist only for (D, t_i) pairs where t_i was actually
        issued in the chunk. No fabrication of filter entries from earlier issuances.
        This is the load-bearing correctness property; everything else is bookkeeping.
      INVARIANT 2: For any path_df row at (D, t_i): remaining_pred is computed from
        pred_raw[t_i, h=1..N_D-i] only -- never from any other issuance.
      INVARIANT 3: observed_so_far for (D, t_i) is sum(true_raw[realization=b_k]) for
        k=0..i-1, sourced anywhere in the chunk -- this is permissible because true_raw
        is the realized value (model-conditioning-independent), not a model output.
      INVARIANT 4: The slice length N_D - i is computed from N_D (session-specific via
        the calendar) and i (issuance position). Off-by-one here is the most likely
        bug; smoke test 4 catches it.
      INVARIANT 5: Every drop is counted in attrs with a category-specific key, never
        silent.

    Note: this filter today supports only the open-time decision (the i=0 row
    drives ``daily_df.pred_var`` under ``summary_extract='session_open'``).
    The full ``path_df`` is produced for diagnostics; consuming the path for
    a continuously-rebalanced multi-period strategy is deferred — see
    ``writeup/future_work.md#STRAT-05``.

    Simplifying assumptions
    -----------------------
    (i)   IV level is frozen for the day after the open observation. The
          single scalar returned by `iv_provider.get_atm_iv(D)` drives every
          bar of session `D`; intraday IV moves are not modeled. See
          ``writeup/future_work.md#STRAT-01``.
    (ii)  No skew, smile, or term structure — a single ATM IV scalar drives
          all gamma calcs. The function does not consult any surface
          (strike-, tenor-, or moneyness-dependent IV) anywhere. See
          ``writeup/future_work.md#STRAT-01``.
    (iii) Strike is fixed at ATM-at-open: `K = S(b_0(D))`. Other strike
          policies (rolling-ATM, fixed-strike, vol-targeted) are out of
          scope and raise ``NotImplementedError``. See
          ``writeup/future_work.md#STRAT-06``.
    (iv)  Delta hedge rebalances every bar (``hedge_freq=1``); ``r=0`` and
          no dividends. The discrete-bar P&L expression below is the
          frictionless 30-min-rebalance approximation of the continuous
          gamma-P&L integral; coarser hedging cadences inject un-hedged
          delta exposure into the realized P&L. See
          ``writeup/future_work.md#STRAT-04``.

    Algorithm (per trade_date `D` in ``daily_df``)
    ----------------------------------------------
    1. ``K = S(b_0(D))`` from ``underlying_prices`` at session-open bar.
    2. ``sigma_imp = iv_provider.get_atm_iv(D)``.
    3. ``tau_full_day = N_D / (252 * 48)`` where ``N_D = daily_df.expected_bars[D]``.
    4. ``position_sign = sign(daily_df.pred_var[D] - sigma_imp**2 * tau_full_day)``.
       Uses ``np.sign`` returning -1/0/+1.
    5. For each bar ``b_k`` in ``_session_bars(D, '16:00')``:
         - ``S_k = underlying_prices.loc[b_k]``
         - ``tau_remaining = (N_D - k) * Delta_tau_bar``
         - ``gamma_k = _bs_gamma(S_k, K, sigma_imp, tau_remaining)``
         - ``DollarGamma_k = 2 * gamma_k * S_k**2`` (factor 2 = call + put
           gamma at ATM straddle)
         - ``true_raw_bar`` = realized variance of ``b_k`` taken from
           ``chunk_df``: any row whose ``date`` (realization timestamp)
           equals ``b_k`` (``true_raw`` is model-conditioning-independent).
         - ``expected_var_bar = sigma_imp**2 * Delta_tau_bar``
         - ``pnl_bar = 0.5 * DollarGamma_k * (true_raw_bar - expected_var_bar) * position_sign``
    6. Sum bar P&L per ``D``. If ``position_sign != 0`` apply a transaction
       cost of ``cost_bps * 1e-4 * notional`` once per trade_date, where
       ``notional = K`` (a proxy — full-spec P&L would charge against the
       straddle premium, not the strike, but the strike-as-notional proxy is
       order-of-magnitude correct for ATM and avoids requiring an option
       pricer in the scaffold).

    Parameters
    ----------
    daily_df : pd.DataFrame
        Output of ``filter_intraday_estimate``'s daily summary. Required
        columns: ``trade_date``, ``pred_var``, ``real_var``, ``n_bars``,
        ``expected_bars``, ``full_day``.
    chunk_df : pd.DataFrame
        The original chunk DataFrame. Required columns: ``date`` (bar
        realization timestamp), ``true_raw``. Used to look up the per-bar
        realized variance.
    iv_provider : IVProvider
        Anything implementing ``get_atm_iv(trade_date) -> float`` returning
        annualized ATM IV at session open of ``trade_date``.
    underlying_prices : pd.Series
        Reconstructed underlying price series, indexed by bar end-timestamp.
        See ``_reconstruct_underlying_prices``.
    strike_policy : str, default 'atm_at_open'
        Only ``'atm_at_open'`` is supported. Anything else raises
        ``NotImplementedError`` referencing ``STRAT-06``.
    cost_bps : float, default 0.0
        Round-trip transaction cost in basis points of notional. Charged
        once per trade_date when ``position_sign != 0``.

    Returns
    -------
    daily_pnl_series : pd.Series
        Total daily P&L, indexed by ``trade_date``.
    bar_pnl_df : pd.DataFrame
        Per-bar diagnostic with columns ``trade_date``, ``bar_timestamp``,
        ``S``, ``K``, ``sigma_imp``, ``tau_remaining``, ``gamma``,
        ``dollar_gamma``, ``true_raw_bar``, ``expected_var_bar``,
        ``pnl_bar``, ``position_sign``, ``hedge_freq``.

    Notes
    -----
    The ``hedge_freq`` column in ``bar_pnl_df`` is currently always 1 by
    assumption (iv); it is included so the assumption travels with any
    saved diagnostic and a future relaxation (``STRAT-04``) does not change
    the schema.
