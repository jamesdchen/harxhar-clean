# D1 changelog — tightening the close-option story (2026-09-29, agent W11)

One change per commit, each revertible on its own (`git revert <sha>`; later
changes that build on an earlier one are marked **depends on**). Every number
quoted below is read from the executed output named beside it; in the paper every
new number is a `\cm...` macro written by `writeup/make_table_close_main.py` from
those files (nothing typed by hand), with the source named in a comment on the line.

Build of record before any change (commit `1f5c6be`): `main.pdf` 67 pages, 12
overfull boxes (none in Section 5.4; the largest are the appendix protocol table and
the strategy-variation longtables), one multiply-defined label
(`tab:app_strategy_variations_res_short`, inside `generated/strategy_variations.tex`,
not touched here), no undefined references.

## 1. Map of the story before editing

### 1.1 What the front matter promises about the close

| where | promise | scorer / source |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | nothing (the option reading was parked from the abstract on 2026-08-18) | — |
| Introduction, 4th finding | the sign of the gap $s=\widehat{RV}-\mathrm{IV}^2$ is the tradable content; forecast and implied disagree on 32–41 % of days; sign(s) improves on always short for all eight forecast columns, "exactly one of the eight is resolved at 95 %, marginally"; sizing on the magnitude does not help; headline column = the block-diagonal ridge on the FOMC design, four comparators on the earlier design | deck (session-bar recalibration), typed numbers |
| Related works, last paragraph | "what the forecast adds is **size** on that short rather than a directional flip" | **contradicts** the results: only the sign is used and sizing does not help (Section 5.4; Appendix D.11; `results/close_kelly/`) |
| Conclusion | same claims as the introduction | deck, typed |

### 1.2 What Section 5.4 (`sections/results_close_option.tex`) actually shows

- **One table** (`generated/table_rule_by_strategy_paper.tex`, from
  `results/atm_straddle_0dte_1530/rule_by_strategy_*.csv`, rv_iv notebook): the paper's
  eight forecasts, all fitted on all 48 bars of the day, **deck scorer** (Mincer–Zarnowitz
  map over the regular-session bars, 250 sessions), **midpoint only**. Block-diagonal
  ridge 1.34; the column ordering is "not asserted".
- **Prose, every number deck scorer and mostly on the block-diagonal ridge**: control
  (0.014/day, Sharpe 0.20); paired improvements 0.76–1.31 with 7 of 8 intervals
  including zero; headline 1.34 [0.27, 2.42]; FOMC-column gap +0.07; sample splits
  (1.51 without Q1-2020; 0.98 / 1.63 around 16 May 2022); pin days (43 % of the return);
  eight rows = 1.8 bets; the threshold decomposition of QLIKE and the Murphy diagram
  (`generated/table_murphy_1530.tex`, macros `\mur...`, study 59); same-day regression
  (figure `regression_R_on_signal_blk2.png`); crossed spread 1.34 → 0.87; shift test
  0.48 / 1.34 / 3.11; compounding at 3 % of wealth (7.2×).
- **Not in the paper at all**: the 15:30-specific (per-bar) linear models, the per-bar
  trees (untuned and causally tuned), the master table, the P&L decomposition, the
  strategy variations (Appendix D hook only), the post-2024 record (Appendix D.5 only).

### 1.3 Where the evidence is not apples-to-apples

| # | issue | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Two scorers.** The paper's table and prose use the deck's session-bar map; every per-bar, tree and master-table comparison made since 2026-09-20 uses the 16:00-bar recalibration $(f^2+s)B$. The same forecast reads 1.34 (deck) and 1.00 (16:00-bar) — so nothing tonight can be set beside the paper's table. | `results/close_master_table/SUMMARY.md` (reference row); `results/close_pnl_decomp/SUMMARY.md` (1.34 deck) |
| 2 | **Headline forecast.** The section's headline is the block-diagonal ridge; the master table recommends the per-bar ridge on the live-feasible set (1.90 / 1.44; +0.90 [+0.19, +1.66] vs the block-diagonal ridge). | `master_table.csv` |
| 3 | **Several things move at once** between the paper's forecast and the per-bar models (design, window, 48 bars vs one bar, inputs, estimator). The master table carries a pooled twin (same specification, all 48 bars) that isolates one of them; the paper shows none. | `master_table.csv` family "pooled twin" |
| 4 | **Fills.** The table is midpoint only; the crossed spread appears for one forecast in prose and as the last column of the Murphy table, so the two fills never sit side by side for all forecasts. | `table_rule_by_strategy_paper.tex`, `table_murphy_1530.tex` |
| 5 | **Intervals.** The paired intervals quoted (vs always short) are deck-scorer; none against the paper's own forecast; no interval for the per-bar vs 48-bar comparison. | prose lines 60–68 |
| 6 | **Numbers typed in prose** (all of 5.4 except the `\mur` macros), from the notebook's executed output; not re-derivable from a script at build time. | `results_close_option.tex` |
| 7 | **Four of the eight columns on an earlier design panel** (†), and two tree columns from a lost menu — the paper's own forecast set is not like-for-like; the per-bar family is (one design, one window, one target). | methods, "Which panel produced which row"; `results/spxw_pnl/MANIFEST.md` |
| 8 | **A result stated inside the methods**: "implied variance exceeds the forecast on 59 to 68 % of days (60 % for the headline)" — deck numbers, and the headline changes. | `methods_close_option.tex` "Scoring and control" |
| 9 | **The sample's end.** Section 5.4 says the 413 days after April 2024 "appear nowhere below", but Appendix D.5 now reports the trade's live form on them (no edge); the main text never says so. | `sections/appendix_running.tex` D.5 |
| 10 | **Wording.** "package" throughout (the wording rule is *straddle*, defined once); the straddle is defined in the methods only as the case where the two strikes coincide. | methods / results |
| 11 | **Appendix D conventions** point to Table 7 for the 866 days and the $\sqrt{252}$ convention and take the block-diagonal ridge as their forecast; they are W7's and are not edited here — the label `tab:close_option_rules` is kept on the new table so their references stay true (same days, same annualization). | `appendix_running.tex` lines 33–46 |

### 1.4 Plan (smallest and safest first; one commit each)

1. Methods: define the per-bar forecasts (with design column names and a key) and the
   16:00-bar recalibration — definitions only, nothing in the results changes.
2. (a) One scorer: the results table becomes selected rows of the master table
   (`make_table_close_main.py` → `generated/table_close_main.tex`), the deck table is
   parked (commented, dated); the prose that reads the table is re-read on the new table.
   The headline stays the paper's forecast in this step.
3. (b) Headline forecast = per-bar ridge on the live-feasible set, and why.
4. (c) Tuned trees (A2b).
5. (d) Where the P&L comes from (tail trade; month-ends; difference to always short).
6. (e) Strategy variations → Appendix D.
7. (f) Park the deck-scorer diagnostics into Appendix D (`sections/appendix_running_parked.tex`).
8. (g) Introduction / conclusion reconciled; the related-works error fixed as its own change.
9. Wording: package → straddle.
